# Tags and Posts Specifictions

1. Fonts you need: (These fonts can be found at Google Fonts)
   -    Merriweather:
        -    font-weight: Bold (700)
   -    Poppins:
        -    font-weight: Regular (400) and semiBold (600)
   
2. Use your fonts accordingly and where you need them
```CSS
    body {
        font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
        font-weight: 400;
    }

    h1 {
        font-famiiy: 'Merriwether', serif;
        font-weight: 700;
    }
```


3. Do not forget to link your fonts in the `<head></head>` element.

4. Tags design should have a `:hover`` effect and a mouse pointer for each element inside the ***Tags*** design. See 'modeling' tag as what to do for `:hover`.

5. The same applies to 'Recent Posts' design.


6. Everything you need is inside `/design` and `/images` folder.
